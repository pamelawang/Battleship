Files attached: AllStats.java, allstats.txt, BattleshipGUI.java, Boat.java, Cell.java, ComputerPlayer.java, Game.java, GamePanel.java, GridButton.java, intro.png, PlaceBoatPanel.java, Player.java, Stats.java, StatsPanel.java, WelcomePanel.java

Notes:
-shoot(p, x, y) in ComputerPlayer.java isn't fully functional: gets stuck on the case where Computer 'aims' at a wall and still trying to use the try-catch statement to loop back/get new coordinates again
-turn() isn't used in Game.java - was used in our Stage 1, when boats were length of 1 Cell
-Buttons in GamePanel don't change colour when pressed (miss, hit). Can still play but lacking visual indicator.
-ComputerPlayer.java doesn't use/overwrites any shooting-related methods from Player because it handles it differently
-StatsPanel.java doesn't work; idea was that by entering in a username and pressing the button the programme would open the .txt file with all the stats information and display that specific user.

Future implementations:
-2 human users playing the game
-have difficulty levels (different sized grids, boats)
-have a special shoot (bomb) - we have written the code for this in Player.java through gotBombed(), but haven't implemented it into gameplay
-have a more intelligient shooting algorithm
  e.g. of what it currently does
        - - H H B B - - (sea sea hit hit boat boat sea sea)
   next turn:
        - M H H B B - -
   next turn (doesn't follow the boat anymore, does randomiser))
-exportFile() in AllStats - be able to export list of users' scores in a .txt file
-StatsPanel being able to use a .txt document to display searchable user information
-fixing buttons in GamePanel to change colour
